## Introduction

## Dataset
In this electroencephalography (EEG) study, we used single-trial classification to perform a Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) of categorical representation of objects in human visual cortex. Brain responses were recorded while participants viewed a set of 72 photographs of objects with a planned category structure. The Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM) used for RSA was derived from confusions of a linear classifier operating on single EEG trials.  
Ten participants, aged 21 to 57 years (median age 30.5 years; 3 female; 1 left-handed), took part in the experiment. All participants reported normal color vision and either normal or corrected-to-normal vision.   
72 photographs of real objects were used as stimuli, taken from the 92-image set used in past RSA studies. The quantity of inanimate images is reduced in the set in order to ensure that each image category would contain the same number of exemplars—specifically, 12 images from each of the following six categories: Human Body (HB), Human Face (HF), Animal Body (AB), Animal Face (AF), Fruit Vegetable (FV), and Inanimate Object (IO).  
Each participant completed two experimental sessions, each containing three blocks, spaced between six and eight days apart. In total, each participant completed 72 trials of each of the 72 images, for a total of 5,184 trials per participant.
