## Introduction
Electroencephalogram(EEG) measures and records the electrical impulses which is produced by the brain's neurons by attaching electrodes to the scalp. Traditional machine learning approaches such as CNN and RNN failed to utilize the spatial relations of the EEG electrodes. With GNN, we can exploit the spatial information, which shows potential for improvement. Therefore, our goal is to create a GNN model and make it perform as good as possible. In this project, the EEG signal includes 124 channels (electrodes), and the sampling rate is 62.5Hz,  32 samples per trial.
## Dataset 
Ten participants, aged 21 to 57 years (median age 30.5 years; 3 female; 1 left-handed), took part in the experiment. All participants reported normal color vision and either normal or corrected-to-normal vision.   
72 photographs of real objects were used as stimuli, taken from the 92-image set used in past RSA studies. The quantity of inanimate images is reduced in the set in order to ensure that each image category would contain the same number of exemplars—specifically, 12 images from each of the following six categories: Human Body (HB), Human Face (HF), Animal Body (AB), Animal Face (AF), Fruit Vegetable (FV), and Inanimate Object (IO).

Each participant completed two experimental sessions, each containing three blocks, spaced between six and eight days apart. In total, each participant completed 72 trials of each of the 72 images, for a total of 5,184 trials per participant.
